When I was fourteen, I dreamed of becoming a math professor because I loved solving complex problems. But over time, I realized that equations alone didn’t change people’s daily lives — and that realization sparked a theme that’s run through my life ever since: bridging analytical thinking with real-world impact.

To pursue that, I studied computer science and business. During college, I thought I’d become a consultant, but I decided to intern with the strategy team at Hyperconnect, the company behind Azar and Hakuna. My job was to analyze these apps from an outsider’s perspective and identify ways to improve user experience. I mapped user journeys, divided them into beginner, enthusiast, and maniac stages, and proposed funnel improvements to deepen engagement.

When I shared my analysis with leadership, they gave me access to internal data on Amplitude — my first time working with real, messy user data. As I analyzed how small design tweaks could shift millions of user behaviors, I was fascinated. After my final presentation, the CEO asked, “How about working as a product manager?”

That single question changed my path. I realized product management was the perfect blend of what I loved — analysis, empathy, and impact.

Since then, I’ve managed products across live streaming, food delivery, and fintech — from small startups to large-scale platforms — learning how to balance experimentation with execution.

At Hyperconnect, I focused on user engagement, learning how small design changes could spark massive behavior shifts across global audiences. At DoEat, a Series-A food delivery startup, I experienced the chaos and creativity of early-stage growth, running fast iterations with limited data and resources. And at Toss Bank, one of Korea’s leading digital banks, I shifted gears to building scalable financial products — leading projects that touched millions of users while navigating strict regulations and complex data ecosystems.

Through these experiences, I learned that great PMs don’t just ship features — they translate human needs into systems that work at scale.

Now, as an MBA student at Berkeley Haas, I’m continuing my PM journey — exploring how technology and behavioral design can drive meaningful change in how people manage their money, health, and time.

Long-term, I hope to keep building mission-driven products that improve people’s lives through thoughtful design and data-driven insight.
