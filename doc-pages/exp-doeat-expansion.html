        Drove regional expansion from 1 to 5 cities by orchestrating a GTM strategy leveraging local partnerships and data‑driven campaigns with sales, marketing and CS, achieving 50% membership penetration within 1 month
    </p>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            DoEat had product-market fit in its launch district but needed a repeatable growth playbook before the Series B raise; we targeted four new cities with distinct culinary ecosystems and competitive landscapes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Expansion risked operational overload—merchant supply, couriers, and customer support were tuned for one region, and national campaigns underperformed due to hyper-local dining habits.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Built city launch pods blending sales, ops, and marketing; negotiated anchor partnerships with leading dessert chains, localized onboarding flows, and scheduled in-app promos around regional food events.
        </p>

        <h4>Analytics</h4>
        <p>
            Tracked cohort retention, membership penetration, and delivery SLA in a Looker dashboard; used demand heatmaps to reallocate rider supply and prioritized CRM experiments per city persona.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>
            Expanded from 1 to 5 cities within a quarter, hit 50% membership penetration within the first month post-launch, and sustained NPS above 60 despite 4x order volume growth.
        </p>

    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Follow-up Actions</h4>
        <p>
            Productized the launch checklist, built a central command center for live metrics, and handed off city operations with clear guardrails on promo spend and merchant SLAs.
