        Viral Engine
    </h3>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Referral performance plateaued because invites felt transactional; we needed an always-on engine that could ride social trends while reinforcing Toss Bank&apos;s trusted brand voice.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Legacy campaigns required manual launches and decayed quickly; engineering capacity was constrained, and compliance required rigorous messaging controls for any shareable asset.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Designed a modular viral platform with collectible cards, social proof streaks, and loss-aversion copy variants; automated triggers based on behavioral milestones and embedded dynamic CTA deep links.
        </p>

        <h4>Analytics &amp; Iteration</h4>
        <p>
            Instrumented share funnels, tracked virality (K-factor) in Amplitude, and A/B tested value propositions weekly; partnered with compliance to pre-approve message templates for rapid experimentation.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>
            Generated 100M+ shares in the first 72 hours, scaled across squads to onboard 3M+ additional users (≈40% of customer base), and sustained a K-factor above 1.4 during peak weeks.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Follow-up Actions</h4>
        <p>
            Open-sourced the experimentation framework internally, enabled growth squads to launch new motifs independently, and integrated fraud detection signals to guard against incentive abuse.
