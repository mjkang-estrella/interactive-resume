        Launched ‘Challenge Account’ for group challenge participants, achieving 300K+ MAU within one month (fastest in company history), 70%+ week‑1 retention, ultimately reducing company‑wide churn by 5%
    </p>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Social Squad was tasked with defending engagement among challenge cohorts that powered Toss Bank&apos;s social growth flywheel but showed weakening retention after challenge completion.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Challenge participants lacked a shared savings workflow once the event ended, leading to 35% churn within two weeks and limited opportunities to cross-sell high-value financial products.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Partnered with compliance, finance, and engineering to design &apos;Challenge Account&apos;—a shared balance with auto-progress dashboards, accountability nudges, and host controls for incentives—shipped in six weeks via phased beta.
