        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Live streaming growth was flattening and competition intensified; we were charged with expanding Hakuna&apos;s audience by blending metaverse-style immersion with creator-led entertainment.
        </p>

    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            New users struggled to discover engaging rooms, and existing fans wanted deeper participation beyond chat. Prior experiments outside the broadcast room underperformed on retention.
        </p>

    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Authored a one-year roadmap delivering 20+ launches: Live Festa discovery map, Virtual Live Rooms with avatar navigation, and in-room minigames that reimagined the broadcast as a shared playground.
        </p>

        <h4>Analytics &amp; Iteration</h4>
        <p>
            Deployed A/B tests on discovery flows, tracked time-spent and CTR across iterations, and paired weekly creator interviews with survey pulses to prioritize feature pivots (e.g., in-room minigames).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>
            Metaverse Live reached 100K+ MAU, boosted viewing time by 2x versus prior flows, and delivered a sustained 10% lift in overall user growth while spawning marketing campaigns with 3.6x higher CTR.
        </p>

        <h4>Follow-up Actions</h4>
        <p>
            Established a content operations squad to rotate minigame experiences, set up creator councils for roadmap co-creation, and documented the metaverse experimentation framework for adjacent teams.
