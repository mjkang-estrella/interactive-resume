        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            As the CPO team&apos;s product strategy intern, I supported Hakuna&apos;s 2021 planning cycle; leadership needed clarity on which user segments fueled retention to prioritize roadmap bets.

    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Existing dashboards lumped all users together, masking differences between casual viewers, gift senders, and aspiring creators; roadmap debates lacked grounded numbers on segment value.
        </p>

    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Pulled 3M+ behavioral events from Amplitude, built cohort definitions using RFM-style clustering, and collaborated with designers to map friction points for high-potential segments across the journey.
