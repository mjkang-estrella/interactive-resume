        Rate Strategy
    </h3>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Joint accounts were Toss Bank&apos;s flagship relationship product, but funding costs spiked as the Bank of Korea raised rates; leadership asked Social Squad to protect margin without undoing user growth.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Blanket rate cuts risked mass churn, yet current pricing disproportionately subsidized dormant couples; we needed a data-backed alternative acceptable to risk, treasury, legal, and CX teams.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Conducted 30+ qualitative interviews and churn analysis to design tiered incentives: -1.7% base rate offset by milestone boosts for active savers plus contextual education in-app and via CRM.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Stakeholder Alignment</h4>
        <p>
            Facilitated weekly decision reviews with 40+ stakeholders across finance, compliance, legal, and operations; delivered scenario modelling deck quantifying NPS, churn, and balance impact to earn sign-off.
        </p>

    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Analytics</h4>
        <p>
            Built Treasury vs. retention dashboards to monitor migration between tiers, set guardrails for net promoter score dips, and triggered contingency offers if high-value cohorts signaled risk.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>
            Achieved $4.3M annualized savings in interest expense with flat retention and stable NPS; dormant cohorts reactivated via milestone boosters, lifting active joint account balances by 9%.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Follow-up Actions</h4>
        <p>
            Extended the pricing decision framework to savings pods and created a quarterly cross-functional pricing council to revisit rate moves under different macroeconomic scenarios.
