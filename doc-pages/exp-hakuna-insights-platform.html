        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Hakuna&apos;s teams relied on siloed spreadsheets and delayed BI pulls; fast iteration on Metaverse Live and revenue experiments demanded trustworthy, self-serve data.

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Logging standards varied across squads, user IDs were inconsistent between mobile and web, and campaign reporting took over a weekâ€”forcing PMs to decide on intuition instead of insights.
        </p>

            Drafted a data governance policy, partnered with infra to unify event schemas, and migrated pipelines into a central warehouse. Built real-time dashboards in Looker/Metabase with SLA alerts for anomalies.
