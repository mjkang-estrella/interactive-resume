        Designed and scaled a dessert‑giveaway reactivation program, boosted dormant‑user returns 3x, membership conversions 5x, and maintaining 2x higher long‑term retention compared to baseline
    </p>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            After rapid expansion, dormant cohorts ballooned—especially light users who saw DoEat as a weekend treat; we needed a retention lever that felt delightful yet was margin conscious.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Blanket coupons eroded unit economics and failed to create habit; we required a targeted program that reintroduced users to the evolving menu while showcasing membership benefits.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Launched a surprise dessert giveaway triggered by churn probability scores, partnering with top-rated bakeries; bundled a free item with a membership trial and contextual storytelling in push/email.

        <h4>Analytics &amp; Iteration</h4>
        <p>
            Built an uplift model comparing treated vs. control cohorts, monitored basket size, and A/B tested reward thresholds; iterated packaging based on qualitative feedback about perceived value.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>
            Dormant user reactivations tripled, membership conversions jumped 5x among the cohort, and reactivated users retained at twice the baseline after 90 days while keeping contribution margin positive.
        </p>
