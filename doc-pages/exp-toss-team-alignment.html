    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Social Squad was an 18-person pod spanning product, design, engineering, data, CX, and brand; rapid headcount growth created misaligned priorities and ad-hoc delivery rituals.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Teams lacked a shared view of outcomesâ€”roadmaps drifted toward feature volume, quarterly reviews were retroactive, and psychological safety dipped in engagement pulses.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Introduced outcome-based OKRs, bi-weekly discovery reviews, and structured feedback cadences; implemented Miro-based planning templates and Jira dashboards to visualize progress vs. impact.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Iteration</h4>
        <p>
            Ran anonymous health checks each sprint, adjusted rituals per squad feedback, and codified decision logs so leadership could unblock escalations within 24 hours.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>
            Engagement survey showed 95% satisfaction, teammate retention improved to 100% through the next two quarters, and cycle time on high-priority experiments dropped by 22%.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Follow-up Actions</h4>
        <p>
            Scaled the operating cadence to adjacent squads, shared templates at the product guild, and baked the health-check survey into onboarding for new PMs and chapter leads.
