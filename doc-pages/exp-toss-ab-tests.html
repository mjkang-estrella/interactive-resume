        Prioritized and conducted 15+ dataâ€‘driven A/B tests across acquisition funnel that addressed key friction points identified through data analysis and qualitative user research, increasing conversion rate by 15%
    </p>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            The new-account funnel spanned marketing landing pages, eKYC, and funding; we inherited scattered analytics and inconsistent hypotheses from rapid early growth.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Completion rate stalled and attribution was noisy; no single team owned a unified experimentation backlog, making it hard to learn quickly or invest engineering time wisely.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Built an experimentation playbook combining funnel analytics, survey insights, and usability testing; established a weekly triage to scope A/B tests with design and engineering, covering copy, flows, and identity checks.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Analytics</h4>
        <p>
            Centralized metrics in Amplitude and BigQuery, defined guardrail KPIs (fraud, time-to-approve), and automated significance reports to ship learnings within 48 hours of each test.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>
            Ran 15+ high-impact experiments over two quarters, lifted funnel conversion by 15%, and reduced drop-offs during identity verification by 22% without increasing manual review workload.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Follow-up Actions</h4>
        <p>
            Transitioned the backlog to a permanent growth experimentation guild and documented learnings to accelerate future launches across lending and deposits funnels.
