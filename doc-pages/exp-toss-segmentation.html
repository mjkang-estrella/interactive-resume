        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Toss Bank&apos;s Club and Partner segments were growing but lacked differentiated product journeysâ€”most members saw generic in-app surfaces despite distinct financial behaviors.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Engagement dropped after onboarding because high-intent couples, roommates, and clubs expected tailored workflows; we needed segmentation robust enough to power personalization and marketing automation.
        </p>

    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Partnered with data science to mine 1M+ user events in Snowflake using SQL and Python; surfaced five durable persona clusters, then mapped each to bespoke dashboards, shared goals, and nudges in-app and CRM.

        <h4>Analytics &amp; Iteration</h4>
        <p>
            Implemented lookalike modelling to measure conversion lift, ran weekly pulse surveys per persona, and iterated on feature gating, copy, and rewards based on funnel drop-offs and sentiment trends.

        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>
            Persona-led experiences lifted NPS by 20 points and drove a 30% uptick in daily joint account openings while reducing support tickets about confusing shared finances by 35%.
        </p>
