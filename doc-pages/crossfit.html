        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Weekend athletes in my CrossFit community wanted actionable feedback between coaching sessions.
            Wearables captured plenty of data, but coaches lacked time to interpret trends or spot injuries early.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Manual video reviews and spreadsheet logging didn’t scale—athletes missed PRs, and coaches could not
            personalize programming for remote members. We needed a faster, insight-driven loop.
        </p>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            Designed CrossFit Analyzer: a mobile-first companion that ingests Garmin/Whoop metrics, uses pose estimation
            on barbell videos, and routes findings through an LLM tuned on CrossFit coaching cues to surface recovery
            and skill recommendations.

        <h4>Analytics &amp; Iteration</h4>
        <p>
            Instrumented each release against session tagging accuracy, RPE deltas, and survey feedback. Added mobility
            nudges when recovery flags spiked and improved lift detection after labeling 400+ reps with coaches.
        </p>

        <h4>Result &amp; Next Steps</h4>
        <p>
            Early pilot teams logged 25% higher training consistency and reported fewer overuse injuries. Expanding the
            dataset with partner gyms and exploring PT integrations to build a holistic performance + recovery playbook.
