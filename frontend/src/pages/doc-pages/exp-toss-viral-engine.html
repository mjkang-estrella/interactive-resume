    <h2>Scalable Viral Loop</h2>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            After successfully achieving record-breaking acquisition results through reward and referral programs, our next challenge at Toss Bank was to design a sustainable viral-growth system — one that could continue to generate user inflow organically without relying on costly incentives or repetitive campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditional referral models reward users only when they invite <em>new</em> users, which creates a natural ceiling: once a user’s friends have already joined, the loop stops. For a bank that had already surpassed six million customers, this model was becoming inefficient and unsustainable.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The core issue was how to build a viral loop that doesn’t die after the first wave of adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
            Existing referral systems:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Required users to <em>find unregistered friends</em> manually — increasing friction.</li>
            <li>Offered one-time incentives that quickly lost novelty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We needed a mechanism that allowed <em>continuous sharing among existing users</em> while still appealing to new users through a contextual, emotionally resonant experience.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Behavioral Psychology Framework</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed the system around <em>intrinsic motivators</em>: social reciprocity, emotional connection, and seasonal relevance.</li>
                    <li>Shifted the growth model from transactional referrals to social gestures — messages users <em>wanted</em> to send, not <em>had</em> to.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Redesigned Viral Loop Architecture</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Created a structure where members could share with both members and non-members, earning small, repeatable rewards (under one cent per share).</li>
                    <li>This ensured the loop remained self-sustaining, as users could participate repeatedly without exhausting their network.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Seasonal Event Campaigns</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed 10+ viral campaigns within six months, each themed around emotional, culturally relevant moments such as <em>Korean Thanksgiving (Chuseok)</em> and <em>New Year’s greetings</em>.</li>
                    <li>Each campaign provided a message template users could personalize and share — optimized for speed and social spread.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scalable System &amp; Modularization</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built the entire viral engine as a reusable module, documented its architecture, and shared it across squads.</li>
                    <li>Enabled teams managing other products (e.g., foreign currency accounts, savings products) to easily plug in the viral system.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h3>Result &amp; Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            The Korean Thanksgiving campaign alone generated <strong>100M+ shares within 72 hours</strong>, attracting 200K new users in just three days.
        </p>
        <p>
            After being scaled across multiple squads, the system drove 3M+ additional new accounts, representing ~40% of Toss Bank’s total customer base. Beyond growth, the viral engine became a core internal framework for how Toss Bank designed behaviorally-driven growth mechanics — turning user emotion and social connection into a scalable acquisition system.
