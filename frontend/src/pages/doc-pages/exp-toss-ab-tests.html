    <h2>Funnel Optimization</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            To optimize Toss Bank’s account-opening funnel, I led an initiative to continuously identify and remove friction points across the user acquisition journey. The funnel served as a critical growth lever, directly affecting conversion rates and overall marketing efficiency.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            While top-of-funnel traffic was growing rapidly, conversion had room of improvement between landing and account completion. Heatmaps, event logs, and user interviews revealed usability gaps — unclear value messaging, long forms, and confusing microcopy. The challenge was not just identifying these issues, but testing and iterating fast enough to validate improvements in a live environment.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Rapid Experimentation Framework:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built an internal process for running <strong>A/B tests within 1–3 days</strong> from idea to release.</li>
                    <li>Partnered closely with designers and developers to shorten review cycles and automate experiment deployment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data + Qualitative Insights:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combined quantitative funnel analysis (drop-off points, completion time) with qualitative user feedback to prioritize high-impact hypotheses.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Iterative Funnel Optimization:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted over 15 rapid A/B tests on onboarding copy, page hierarchy, input-field order, and loading transitions.</li>
                    <li>Used real-time dashboards to monitor conversion deltas and end conditions for each test.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cross-Functional Communication:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shared learnings weekly to standardize best-performing UX patterns across acquisition and marketing teams.</li>

        <h3>Result &amp; Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            The rapid iteration cycle <strong>increased funnel conversion rate by 15%</strong> within weeks and became a model for agile product experimentation inside Toss Bank. By proving that data-driven design and fast execution could coexist, the initiative set a new operational standard for product velocity and evidence-based decision-making.
