    <h2>Regional Expansion</h2>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Doeat was a Series-A food-delivery startup with about 50 employees, focused on serving single-person households through a hyperlocal delivery model. At the time, the service was operating in only one city. Following a successful fundraising round, the company aimed to expand rapidly to new regions.

        <p>
            As the company had no experienced Growth PM, I was brought in temporarily to lead regional expansion and design the go-to-market (GTM) strategy by coordinating across sales, marketing, customer support, and product teams.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The challenge was how to expand from a single-city operation to multiple cities while maintaining quality and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of the hyperlocal model, Doeat’s success depended on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reliable local restaurant partnerships,</li>
            <li>Understanding region-specific customer preferences, and</li>
            <li>Avoiding logistical overload that could break the brand promise of “fast, freshly-cooked delivery.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There was also no established playbook for expansion — each region had unique demand patterns and partner expectations.
