    <h2>Growth Hacking</h2>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            When I joined Toss Bank, the company had just launched but lacked a dedicated Growth team. I became one of the four founding members of the new Growth Squad — a small, cross-functional unit composed of one PM (myself), one designer, and two engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission was clear yet daunting:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Achieve the <strong>fastest user growth in Korean banking history</strong>,</li>
            <li>Maintain <strong>CAC under $3.5 / user</strong>, and</li>
            <li>Sustain <strong>80%+ week-one retention</strong> while driving profitability through strong <strong>LTV/CAC</strong> efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional banks relying on large marketing budgets, we needed to build organic, scalable, and data-driven growth systems that could sustain themselves even with minimal paid acquisition.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The core challenge was how to drive exponential acquisition without over-spending or compromising retention.
        </p>
        <p>
            We faced three constraints:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Limited marketing resources</strong> compared to incumbents.</li>
            <li><strong>Brand new product positioning</strong> — no user trust or brand equity yet.</li>
            <li><strong>A need for repeatable, viral growth engines</strong> that could sustain without ongoing heavy incentives.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            We needed to find a way to make users themselves the distribution channel — turning product delight into a natural acquisition engine.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Launched Reward-Driven Activation Loop</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed an onboarding reward program that offered small cash bonuses for new account openings.</li>
                    <li>This initial campaign created the first acquisition surge, helping seed a viral user base.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Built Organic Viral Mechanisms</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a share-and-invite system inside the banking app — users could share their personalized account link or challenge activity.</li>
                    <li>Added social triggers (e.g., “Your friend just opened a Toss Bank account”) to drive FOMO-based virality.</li>
                    <li>Introduced Twitter-based sharing and limited-time campaigns, leading to mass social diffusion.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Collaborated for Scalable Marketing &amp; SEO</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worked with the marketing team to optimize app store listings and SEO for major keywords and improve organic discovery.</li>
                    <li>Partnered with influencers and content creators to promote new savings and challenge products, leveraging social proof as a growth accelerant.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data-Driven Experimentation</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built dashboards to monitor cohort-level retention, CAC, and viral coefficient (K-factor).</li>
                    <li>Conducted A/B tests on copy, incentive size, and sharing UX.</li>
                    <li>Prioritized experiments using ICE scoring to maximize ROI from a small team.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Iterative Viral System Development (more on next bullet)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Over time, we designed a full viral loop system — allowing users to challenge, share, and invite others seamlessly inside the product.</li>
                    <li>This not only fueled acquisition but also strengthened early engagement, as new users joined through trusted social connections.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Result &amp; Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            The Growth Squad’s initiatives led to <strong>2.1 million new account openings within six months</strong>, achieving <strong>+30% user growth</strong> and establishing <strong>Toss Bank as Korea’s fastest-growing bank</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CAC:</strong> $3.5/user (record low in Korean banking).</li>
            <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Over <strong>80% week-one</strong> sustained across cohorts.</li>
            <li>Shift in focus: The scale of success allowed the company to de-prioritize acquisition and reallocate resources toward retention and engagement, leading to the creation of the Social Squad that I later joined.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This experience taught me that growth is not a single campaign but a system — the intersection of product mechanics, psychology, and data. Building that system from zero with a four-person team remains one of my proudest achievements.
