        <p>
            Resume OS is the AI-first resume experience I built for product hiring teams. It merges the familiar
            one-page narrative with two interactive layers: clickable bullet points reveal deeper portfolio stories, and
            an integrated interview bot answers follow-up questions in real time.

        <h3>Why it matters</h3>
        <ul class="bullets doc-bullets">
            <li>Manual resume screens miss context — reviewers rarely have time to click through case studies.</li>
            <li>AI interview prep tools typically sit outside the resume, forcing candidates to maintain multiple assets.</li>
            <li>Recruiters still want the scan-ability of a tight one-pager, but with faster paths to evidence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <ul class="bullets doc-bullets">
            <li>
                <strong>Interactive bullets:</strong> Each highlight opens a templated deep-dive built with the same
                content system that powers this resume.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Interview bot:</strong> A lightweight ChatKit agent pre-loaded with my project library, designed
                so recruiters can ask “how” questions without scheduling a call.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analytics loop:</strong> Supabase captures which stories and questions get the most attention,
                informing what to emphasize in follow-up conversations.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Early impact</h3>
        <ul class="bullets doc-bullets">
            <li>Cut time-to-context for recruiters by giving them an interactive brief instead of static PDFs.</li>
            <li>In pilot interviews, 3 of 4 hiring managers used the bot to dig deeper before the live call.</li>
            <li>Created a repeatable template other candidates can adapt for their own AI-assisted resumes.</li>
        </ul>
