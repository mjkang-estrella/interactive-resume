        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            The Social Squad at Toss Bank aimed to strengthen user <em>lock-in</em> through social and behavioral features, following the company’s rapid growth in activation metrics driven by the Growth Squad. We wanted to design a product that not only attracted users but also encouraged long-term engagement within the bank ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by the insight that people struggle with waking up early, we decided to link this behavior with a financial incentive — creating a group challenge product called the <strong>Challenge Account</strong>, where participants could deposit money and receive rewards based on successful participation.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The initial idea involved redistributing deposits to users who successfully completed the morning challenge, but it faced <strong>regulatory restrictions</strong>: banks are not allowed to create products where users can lose their principal. This required a fundamental redesign of the business logic while keeping the original motivation intact.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal &amp; Structural Pivot:</strong>
                <p>
                    Collaborated with the Legal and Compliance teams to rebuild the product around interest-based rewards instead of pooled deposits. The system transformed into a <strong>lottery-style structure</strong>, where accumulated interest funded prizes for winners — fully compliant yet still motivating.

                <strong>Engagement Optimization:</strong>
                <p>
                    After rapid initial growth, we noticed a stagnation in participation. We iterated the model by introducing multiple prize tiers (1st–5th place) to ensure that more users experienced wins, which reignited engagement and growth.

                <strong>Community Features:</strong>
                <p>
                    Added social mechanics such as a morning chat room accessible only to early participants, reinforcing the product’s community feel and emotional stickiness.

        <h3>Result &amp; Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            The Challenge Account became the fastest-growing product in company history, achieving <strong>300K+ MAU within one month</strong>, <strong>70%+ week-1 retention</strong>, and ultimately <strong>reducing company-wide churn by 5%</strong>. Beyond the numbers, the project demonstrated how navigating constraints like financial regulations could spark innovative, compliant solutions that still deliver user delight.
