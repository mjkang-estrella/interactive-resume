    <h2>Customer Segmentation &amp; Personalization</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            The Joint Account product served a wide range of users from couples to hobby clubs, but all were being treated as a single user group. To increase relevance and satisfaction, I initiated a project to <strong>personalize user experiences</strong> through behavioral segmentation and modular feature design.

    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The challenge was how to segment users meaningfully without overcomplicating product management. Creating too many variants would fragment resources, yet treating all users identically limited engagement and satisfaction.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Data-Driven Segmentation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyzed over 1 million user behaviors using SQL and Python to identify distinct usage patterns.</li>
                    <li>Segmented users into Couples, Partners, Clubs &amp; Activity Groups, and Others, focusing only on cases with clearly differentiated behaviors.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Personalized Feature Design:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built modular landing pages and functions tailored to each group’s needs — e.g., budgeting tools for couples, shared asset tracking for clubs, and message boards for group coordination.</li>
                    <li>Designed these features as modular components, enabling efficient iteration without heavy maintenance costs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Qualitative Validation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted user interviews and feedback sessions to ensure each segment’s design accurately reflected its core motivations and use cases.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Result &amp; Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            The initiative <strong>increased NPS by 20 points</strong> and <strong>daily joint account openings by 30%</strong>. The segmentation framework became a model for designing scalable personalization, balancing user diversity with operational efficiency.
