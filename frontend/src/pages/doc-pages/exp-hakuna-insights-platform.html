        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            When I worked on the team, all data analysts had recently left, leaving a major operational gap. Teams relied on ad hoc SQL queries on BigQuery, and I became the main contact for data requests across departments. However, inconsistent query logic, fragmented data sources, and lack of centralized policies caused confusion and inefficiency in product decision-making.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            Through discussions with product, engineering, and business teams, I identified three core issues:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>No data collection policy:</strong> Developers were logging events with inconsistent formats and naming conventions, making data unreliable.</li>
            <li><strong>No single source of truth:</strong> Key metrics such as “Active User” or “Retention” were defined differently across teams, leading to misaligned reports and duplicated analyses.</li>
            <li><strong>No centralized dashboards:</strong> Teams lacked visibility into live KPIs and had to run manual queries repeatedly for updates, delaying decisions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            These issues resulted in slow turnaround times, inconsistent insights, and limited trust in data.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Defined and implemented data collection policies:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standardized event-logging structure and naming conventions across teams.</li>
                    <li>Required PMs and engineers to sync on logging schema before each feature release.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Established unified metric definitions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborated with strategy and business teams to create shared definitions for all core KPIs.</li>
                    <li>Published a single source of truth document and trained PMs to apply it consistently.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Centralized data visualization:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learned Tableau from a neighboring team and independently built real-time dashboards for key metrics like MAU, retention, and session engagement.</li>
                    <li>Linked all fragmented data pipelines into one integrated BigQuery dataset accessible to all product teams.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h3>Result &amp; Analytics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduced data turnaround time by 40%</strong>, enabling faster experimentation and decision cycles.</li>
            <li>Improved data accuracy and trust across the organization by enforcing unified definitions.</li>
            <li>The dashboards became the default reference point for product and leadership meetings, removing redundant SQL queries and manual reporting.</li>
            <li>The project created a foundation for scalable, data-driven operations — turning a data bottleneck into a self-service analytics culture.</li>
        </ul>
