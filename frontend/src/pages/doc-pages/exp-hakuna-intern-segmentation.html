        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            When I joined Hyperconnect's CPO team as a product strategy intern, my mission was to analyze the company's flagship apps, Azar and Hakuna Live, through the lens of an external user. The goal was to surface overlooked pain points and growth opportunities without the bias of internal familiarity. I was given broad strategic context and freedom to explore, which led me to spend weeks using both apps, observing user flows, and documenting behavioral patterns.

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Despite strong user acquisition, the engagement and conversion rates between usage stages were inconsistent. There was no clear understanding of what actions differentiated Beginners, Enthusiasts, and Maniacs—the three main engagement levels I identified. Without this behavioral clarity, the team made product decisions around onboarding, retention loops, and monetization without a strong analytical foundation.

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <ol class="bullets doc-bullets">
            <li>
                <strong>User Segmentation Framework:</strong> I classified users into three engagement tiers — <em>Beginners</em>, <em>Enthusiasts</em>, and <em>Maniacs</em> — based on frequency, interaction depth, and social behaviors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Funnel Mapping &amp; Hypothesis Development:</strong> For each tier, I identified the actions required to move users to the next stage and mapped the drop-off points preventing that progression.

            <li>
                <strong>Quantitative Validation via Amplitude:</strong> After the CPO approved my qualitative findings, I gained access to internal Amplitude data covering over 3 million user events. I used it to:
                <ul class="bullets doc-bullets">
                    <li>Measure the conversion rate between engagement tiers.</li>
                    <li>Identify specific bottlenecks in the interaction funnel.</li>
                    <li>Compare as-is vs to-be funnel improvements based on behavioral data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prioritization &amp; Strategic Proposal:</strong> Using the insights, I proposed targeted feature improvements — such as simplified entry points and incentive triggers — ranked by potential impact on engagement and conversion.
