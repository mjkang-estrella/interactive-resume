        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            As Doeat’s user base grew, we noticed through churn analysis that a large portion of inactive users were women—a segment under-served by the platform’s mostly male-oriented meal offerings. To re-engage these users, I designed and launched a reactivation campaign built around personalized incentives and emotional relevance rather than generic discounts.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The key challenge was how to win back churned users whose needs the existing product didn’t address. Purely digital CRM messaging had limited impact, and our internal data suggested that these users disengaged because they didn’t feel personally valued or represented in Doeat’s product lineup.

        <h3>Result &amp; Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            The campaign tripled dormant-user returns, increased membership conversions fivefold, and maintained twice the long-term retention compared to the baseline cohort. Beyond metrics, the project became a cultural example of hands-on, execution-first ability, demonstrating that meaningful growth sometimes requires literally going the extra mile for users.
