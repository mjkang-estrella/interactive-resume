        <h3>Why MBA?</h3>
        <p>
            I came to Haas to bridge three threads of my career — product management, data, and purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before the MBA, I’d built consumer products at Toss Bank and Hyperconnect, where I learned how to ship at scale and translate data into user impact. But I realized that to grow into a global product leader, I needed to strengthen two areas: strategic breadth and human depth by understanding how technology, business models, and human behavior come together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Haas was a natural choice because its culture of “Beyond Yourself” and focus on responsible innovation align with how I want to build products — ones that are useful, ethical, and globally scalable. Here, I’m exploring how AI and data governance shape next-generation fintech and health products, while also improving my leadership through cross-functional teamwork and storytelling.

        <h3>Agentic AI (CS Department)</h3>
        <p>
            As a product manager, understanding AI's capabilities and business impact is crucial, but knowing <em>how</em> to implement it is equally important for building and deploying real-world solutions. That's why I took the Agentic AI course, even though it's from the CS department and focuses on technical implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Agentic AI is an emerging field that promises to transform daily life through intelligent task automation and personalization. This course covered:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fundamental concepts essential for Agentic AI (LLM foundations, reasoning, planning, agentic frameworks, infrastructure)</li>
            <li>Representative agent applications (e.g. code generation, robotics, web automation, scientific discovery)</li>
            <li>Examine the limitations and potential risks of current LLM agents and share insights into directions for further improvement.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Ethics of AI (Philosophy Department)</h3>
        <p>
            I've always been interested in the philosophical implications of AI. As AI rapidly improves, it raises ethical questions around safety, usage, and personality. I've already written several blog posts about this (<a href="https://blog.mj-kang.com/ai-and-philosophy/">AI and Philosophy</a>, <a href="https://blog.mj-kang.com/chatgpt-companionship/">ChatGPT-Companionship</a>). I took this course to extend this interest further and discuss ethical questions with students from other departments.
        </p>
        <p>
            This course covered multiple topics related to AI ethics, including inherent bias, privacy and surveillance, opacity, hallucinations, manipulation, and impact on education.

        <h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
        <p>
            Product management is about identifying user problems and building solutions. I have extensive experience scaling products from 1 to 10 and 10 to 100, but I haven't built anything from 0 to 1, except for individual features within established applications. That's why I took this entrepreneurship class: to learn the fundamentals and gain hands-on experience in early-stage product development.
