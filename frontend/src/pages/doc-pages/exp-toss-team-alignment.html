        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            As a Product Manager in a cross-functional Squad of 6â€“8 members including designers, banking operations, frontend/backend engineers, and data analysts, my goal was to improve both execution speed and team stability. Each squad worked autonomously, so clear communication and shared context were critical to alignment.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The challenge was maintaining consistent alignment and motivation across disciplines as projects scaled. Without structured feedback loops or shared OKRs, teams risked communication gaps, duplicated efforts, and uneven visibility into strategic priorities.
