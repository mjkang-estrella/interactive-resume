    <h2>Interest Rate Reduction</h2>
    <div class="doc-case__section">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Joint Account</strong> product initially offered a 1.8% interest rate — identical to regular savings accounts. However, the product’s unique value came from its social and shared-finance features, not from its interest rate. I hypothesized that <strong>lowering the rate would not significantly affect user retention or growth</strong>, and could instead save substantial costs for the bank.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The main challenge was balancing cost efficiency with user retention. Reducing interest rates risked user churn if customers perceived the product as less rewarding. To move forward, I needed to gather both quantitative validation and stakeholder alignment across legal, finance, and product divisions.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Behavioral Data Analysis:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyzed asset movement during a previous rate reduction (from 2.0% → 1.8%) and compared it with personal accounts.</li>
                    <li>Found that <strong>Joint Account users were less sensitive to rate changes</strong> due to the product’s social engagement features.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Research:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted <strong>30+ user interviews</strong>, confirming that collaboration and shared financial management were the main motivations, not interest rates.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stakeholder Alignment:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Presented findings to over <strong>40 cross-functional stakeholders</strong> including executives, compliance, and finance teams.</li>
                    <li>Built consensus around a <strong>1.7% rate reduction</strong>, supported by cohort retention analysis and customer insights.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Segmentation Strategy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>For interest-sensitive users, created migration paths to alternative savings products to mitigate dissatisfaction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Result &amp; Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            The interest rate adjustment delivered <strong>$4.3M in annual savings</strong> while maintaining user retention and growth stability. The initiative became a model for data-driven pricing decisions at Toss Bank, showing how strategic experimentation could optimize business efficiency without compromising user trust.
